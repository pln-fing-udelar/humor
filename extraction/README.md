# Extraction

This folder contains scripts used to fetch tweets for the HUMOR corpus.

## Setup

You need to create a `.env` file with the content:

```shell
CONSUMER_TOKEN='...'
CONSUMER_SECRET='...'
ACCESS_TOKEN='...'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET='...'
```

## Run

For now, there's only one script that can be run:

```shell
./download_tweets.py
```
